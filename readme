To run the test script, Python 3 and WolframKernal (Mathematica) are needed. The test script requires WolframKernal because the (true) theoretical values of the linear and quadratic gradients are calculated by WolframKernal.
The file quadraticGradientTools.py defines functions
To draw the graphs showing Errors-Iterations and Errors-L/D, run the test script quadraticGradientBPlot.py
To draw the graphs comparing comparing the estimated radius of curvature and helix angle with the true (theoretical) one, run the test script rotationAnalysisCompute.py and then the script rotationAnalysisPlot.py

To run the algorithm, Python 3 is needed. The function {\it multipointsCalculateGradAndGrad2} defined in quadraticGradientTools.py is the main body of the algorithm and calculates the linear and quadratic gradients of a field.
